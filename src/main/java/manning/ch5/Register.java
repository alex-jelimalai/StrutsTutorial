     * exposed by the ValidationAware interface -- already implemented by the ActionSupport class that this action extends. To complete the the validation
     * process, the workflow interceptor fires next in the default stack. It checks for error messages on the action, and if it finds them it diverts workflow
     * back to the input page where the error messages are displayed to the user. In this case, the execute method of the action will not be called because the
     * workflow was diverted, due to validation problems, before execution reached the action itself.
